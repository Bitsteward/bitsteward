# Bitsteward
## If you want to try out Bitsteward, it is highly recommended that you use a vault with data that you do not mind being considered leaked. The current implementation is *not* secure, and any program could potentially see all your vault items. (The screenshots are from a Bitwarden vault created specifically for the development of this application)

Bitsteward is a very early alpha Bitwarden client made with GTK4 and Libadwaita. It is NOT secure at the moment

ðŸš§ The readme is under construction! ðŸš§

## How to run
The first step is to clone the repo in a terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bitsteward/bitsteward.git
cd bitsteward
```
Then, you need to login to a Bitwarden account (I recommend creating a new one to test this app as it is not yet secure)
```bash
chmod +x bw
./bw login
```
Then fill in the steps to login as the prompt tells you.
After that is done, install the python dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The last step is to start the application!
```
python3 src/main.py
```
