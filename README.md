# Bitsteward
## If you want to try out Bitsteward, it is highly recommended that you use a vault with data that you do not mind being considered leaked. The current implementation is *not* secure, and any program could potentially see all your vault items. (The screenshots are from a Bitwarden vault created specifically for the development of this application)

Bitsteward is a very early alpha Bitwarden client made with GTK4 and Libadwaita. It is NOT secure at the moment
